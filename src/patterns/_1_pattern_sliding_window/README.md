# Sliding Window Pattern

The Sliding Window pattern is a technique used to solve problems that involve arrays or lists. It is particularly useful for problems that require finding a subarray or a subset of elements that satisfy a certain condition.

## Key Concepts

- **Fixed Window Size**: The window size is fixed, and the window slides over the array to find the desired result.
- **Dynamic Window Size**: The window size can change dynamically based on the problem's requirements.

## Common Use Cases

- Finding the maximum or minimum sum of a subarray of a fixed size.
- Finding the longest substring with distinct characters.
- Solving problems related to subarrays or substrings.

## Example Problems

- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters
