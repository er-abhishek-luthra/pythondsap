# Slow and Fast Pointers Pattern

The Slow and Fast Pointers pattern, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, is used to detect cycles in linked lists or arrays. It involves using two pointers that move at different speeds to find a cycle or intersection point.

## Key Concepts

- **Cycle Detection**: Detecting cycles in linked lists or arrays.
- **Finding Middle**: Finding the middle of a linked list.

## Common Use Cases

- Detecting cycles in a linked list.
- Finding the middle of a linked list.
- Solving problems related to circular arrays.

## Example Problems

- Linked List Cycle Detection
- Find the Middle of a Linked List
