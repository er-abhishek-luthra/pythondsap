# Two Pointers Pattern

The Two Pointers pattern is a technique used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists. It involves using two pointers to iterate through the data structure, often from different ends, to find a solution.

## Key Concepts

- **Opposite Directions**: Pointers start from opposite ends and move towards each other.
- **Same Direction**: Pointers start from the same end and move in the same direction.

## Common Use Cases

- Finding pairs in a sorted array that sum to a target value.
- Removing duplicates from a sorted array.
- Solving problems related to palindromes.

## Example Problems

- Pair with Target Sum
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
