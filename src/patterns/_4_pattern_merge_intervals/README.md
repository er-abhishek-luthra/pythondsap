# Merge Intervals Pattern

The Merge Intervals pattern is used to solve problems that involve overlapping intervals. It involves sorting the intervals and then merging them based on their start and end times.

## Key Concepts

- **Sorting**: Sorting intervals by their start time.
- **Merging**: Merging overlapping intervals into a single interval.

## Common Use Cases

- Merging overlapping intervals.
- Solving scheduling problems.
- Solving problems related to time intervals.

## Example Problems

- Merge Overlapping Intervals
- Insert Interval
